# IDAObjcTypes
A collection of (public and private) types and functions definitions useful for Objective-C binaries analysis.

## Why even?
Would you rather re-define the same functions or types over and over as you work with different binaries?

## Usage
From inside IDA Pro, simply go to `File > Load file > Parse C header file` then choose `IDA.h` to import everything at once.

Or, run this IDA command: `idaapi.idc_parse_types("/path/to/IDAObjcTypes/IDA.h", idc.PT_FILE)`

If you work with 32-bit binaries, you should uncomment `#define x86` in `IDA.h`.

## Included Frameworks/Libraries
More to be added as the owner reverses more binaries.
